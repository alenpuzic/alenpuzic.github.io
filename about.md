I'm a serial entrepreneur, software engineer and a security geek. I currently live in Austin, TX, USA with my amazing wife 
<a href='http://laurapuzic.com'>Laura</a> and our two mischievous dogs.

My passions lie in software architecture, cybersecurity and product development. In particular, 
I really enjoy working on projects relating to security, scalability, automation and data analytics. 
I love designing beautiful products, from inception stages all the way to public release. My belief is that great 
products are difficult to design not because they are complex, but because they are incredibly simple.

I've been a funder of numerous startups in the past decade. My last company, 
  <a href='https://www.pwnedlist.com'>PwnedList</a>, was acquired in 2013. 

I enjoy watching the World Cup. I love hiking, backpacking and pretty much anything that provides me with an escape
from technology. I love reading both fiction and non-fiction. My favorite pastime is hanging out with my family.
